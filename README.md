## Why do we used GitHub?


## Creating an account on GitHub
To be able to use GitHub, you will have to create an account first. You can do that on their [GitHub Website](https://github.com) and fillout the main form.

 This form is the first thing that appears if you enter the website without being logged in
 
 You need to inform GitHub which plan you want to use. Choose the free option. The only difference is that you can setup private repositories with the paid plan.
