# Git and GitHub Tutorial

## What is GIT?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 

So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

 GitHub is a place to share software repositories and collaborate with other developers.
 
## Why do we used GitHub?
* We can **Contribute** to open source projects.
* It is a **Social Network** for developers.
* We can **Track** changes across mutliple versions in our code.
* We can **Showcase** our work to other developers and recruiters.
* We and other developers can **Collaborate** on a single project easily.

## Creating an account on GitHub
To be able to use GitHub, you will have to create an account first. You can do that on their [GitHub Website](https://github.com) and fillout the main form.

 This form is the first thing that appears if you enter the website without being logged in
 
 You need to inform GitHub which plan you want to use. Choose the free option. The only difference is that you can setup private repositories with the paid plan.

 ## Creating a GitHub Repository
A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in a Git project. It saves this data in a directory called .git, also known as the repository folder.

Follow these steps to create a new repository on GitHub:

1.  Log in and browse to the GitHub home page.
    
2. Find the New repository option under the + sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner.
